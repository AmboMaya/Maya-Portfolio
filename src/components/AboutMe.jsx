		<Element name='target3'>
			<p>I'm Maya. In my spare time I play guitar and sing, and play with my cat Kira. I have recently discovered my interest in gardening too. 
				Eventhough I came from a non-technical background I've always enjoyed being technical and be a problem solver. I love building digital products and creating intuitive websites with a focus on aesthetic offering a great user experience.
				Last year I decided to take the plunge by quitting my steady job and enrolled in the Enspiral Dev Academy. It's an 18 week, 60+ hours per week web development bootcamp with intense learning to become a full-stack web developer.
