        <br/>
        <p>I'm Maya. I love to play guitar and sing, and I have a cat.</p>
        <p>I love building digital products and creating intuitive websites with a focus on aesthetic offering a great user experience. Last year I decided to take the plunge by quitting my steady job and enrolled in the Enspiral Dev Academy. It's an 18 week, 60+ hours per week web development bootcamp with intense learning to become a full-stack web developer.</p>
